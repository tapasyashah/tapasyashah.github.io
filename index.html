  <h3 class="post-title"> Lawn Tennis - How I started?</h3>
  <div class="post-content">

  <p style="font-family:Courier New;">I was five when I started playing tennis. It wasn’t a popular sport at that time. I knew nothing about it nor did my parents have any knowledge. So how this all started, uh? 
It happened due to my first friend in school Angira. She was the one who started playing tennis first. Then I joined. I don’t know if I liked the game then. I was going, playing 
just for the sake to go out, talk to my friend that’s all. It was like that for many years. When I was in 4th grade Angira moved to Bangladesh. It was then after I started playing tennis.</p>
<p style="font-family:Courier New;">I first played School Games when I was in 5th std. I still remember it clearly.  It was my birthday when the district level selection was held. The most astonishing thing was that my 
birthday party had been scheduled in the afternoon. But since the selection was delayed, I was the one to go to my party at last!! Anyways I was then selected in the district team 
and we went to Bhuj for the further tournament. Although I was just a substitute, I learned a lot. Living alone, getting deeper into tennis, having mutual understanding, and things
 that are easy to feel but difficult to explain.</p>

  <h3 class="post-title">You Never Know when you grew overconfident! So Be Careful and Never Underestimate anyone!<br> 
          Be Yourself, Always!</h3>
   
  <div class="post-content">

  <p style="font-family:Helvetica Neue;">It was School Games selection, at Bhuj level 1. I had won 2 rounds and had to win one more
   to qualify for the top 15 of our state.  My match was scheduled with Riya Patel a player from Vadodara rural. It was quite a 
   long since I had played with her. Till I knew she was an ok player. I started being overconfident, thought about the future 
   and you know felt that I had already won against her and getting proud of myself to get to the top 15 of the state. The match
   started. And she was unpredictable. She used both of her hands to play both the stokes- forehand and backhand. Her game was 
   completely new, completely unpredictable. There were only 4 games to win and I lost, that too 4-0. I was stunned, had nothing to say. I was very sad, I cried. Then the next day I analysed my game. I realized that I was always thinking about the lost points and what will happen next? I will lose.   Instead of thinking and improving during the match, I had declared myself a loser and was searching for excuses to give to the world. 
   That match was a big shot on me. Few days were terrible.</p>
   
   <p style="font-family:Helvetica Neue;">But eventually, I focused on my practice.  After a few months, we both
   again met in an open district tournament. I was a little nervous, but due to my past lost I did not have that pressure. There 
   were 7 games to win. I was then 4-0 down. Tensions grew again. my friend, coaches, my parents, my friend’s parents, all was 
   watching and maybe losing hope. at a moment I too. But then I realized that I had nothing to lose hope or had expectations 
   to catch up, ‘cause I had already lost against her at the worst score and at one of the most important match. So I just started
   playing my own game. Free and open. That day I won 7-4.That was one of the most important thing I learned. don’t take any 
   stress. Don’t much think of the world and your future. Be yourself and that’s the only way you can truly win.</p>
   
<p style="font-family:Helvetica Neue;">Again after a few months, we met in the semi-finals of a decathlon sponsored open Baroda 
 tournament. I had a fever at that time but I decided to play, just like that. I and my mother hopped onto our two-wheeler Activa.
 It was 3 pm during the summer. The temp was  around 45° C. And it was a 45 min drive. Any normal person shall have a fever after
 that ride. I went into the academy, sat in a shade, and took paracetamol.  The coach asked me if I was playing or not. I could see 
 her doing the warm-up. I nodded. I Grabbed my kit, did some stretch, and went on the court. That day I won 7-0. I was happy.
 Life had made me learned a lot now. </p> 
   
<p style="font-family:Helvetica Neue;">Tennis teaches not just lessons to be learned on the court but much more than that. It teaches you things that make your life better 
   and happier. It teaches things that are applicable in all aspects of life, transforming you into a better human being.
