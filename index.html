  <h3 class="post-title"> Lawn Tennis - How I started?</h3>
  <div class="post-content">

  <p style="font-family:Courier New;">I was five when I started playing tennis. It wasn’t a popular sport at that time. I knew nothing about it nor did my parents have any knowledge. So how this all started, uh? 
It happened due to my first friend in school Angira. She was the one who started playing tennis first. Then I joined. I don’t know if I liked the game then. I was going, playing 
just for the sake to go out, talk to my friend that’s all. It was like that for many years. When I was in 4th grade Angira moved to Bangladesh. It was then after I started playing tennis.</p>
<p style="font-family:Courier New;">I first played School Games when I was in 5th std. I still remember it clearly.  It was my birthday when the district level selection was held. The most astonishing thing was that my 
birthday party had been scheduled in the afternoon. But since the selection was delayed, I was the one to go to my party at last!! Anyways I was then selected in the district team 
and we went to Bhuj for the further tournament. Although I was just a substitute, I learned a lot. Living alone, getting deeper into tennis, having mutual understanding, and things
 that are easy to feel but difficult to explain.</p>
