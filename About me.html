	Hi Everyone! My name is Tapasya Shah. I am a high school student from India. I have been playing Tennis for about 11 years now. I have been on several treks like 
	<em>Khaliya Top</em> (12000 feet above sea level), <em>Brighu Lake</em> ( 14000 feet above sea level ). Playing Tennis and going on treks are one the
	best decisions I have made. I would like share with you certain incidents/ parts of this journey, some 
	which may bring smile on your face and some will teach you (life lessons).  </p>
  <p style="font-size:22px; font-family:Lucida Bright;"> 
	I also greatly inclined towards science and technology. I hope my bogs will useful to you and be worth your time!
	As it is said that one must learn from other's mistakes. So here I would present my mistakes, errors so that you don't repeat them. And could live to the best! </p>
